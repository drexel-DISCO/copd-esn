# copd-esn

This is the code to build an echo state network using bio signals

The main file is copd_eval.py
It uses the bio signals stored in bio.txt

Currently, I have tested this model with random signal samples, normalized in the range of 0-1 (see bio.txt)
The file requies the following libraries
1. numpy
2. scipy
3. matplotlib

To run the file just type 
python copd_eval.py
